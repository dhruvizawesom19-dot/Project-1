Project 1: Bitboard Checkers Game  Dhruv Patel

This project is split up into two phases, 
Phase 1: Bit Operations
    This Phase is about representing my knowledge of bit manipulation and understanding.
    This includes the ability to set bits to 1 or 0, ability to check bit values and ability to shift bits left and right

Phase 2: Implementing a Bitboard checkers
    This game is required to do many things that a real checkers game can, for example, the game must show the current board state clearly, allow user to move pieces, allow capturing of pieces, allow kings to be promoted, and have a win detection mechanism.

To run this game, you must open the full repository in an IDE of choice, I chose VSCode. In VSCode, open a new terminal, then in that terminal type the folllowing
make
./checkers

Enter make first and allow the ide to compile the code, then use ./checkers to run the code.

To play the game, you will see the sample output and look in the terminal. it will ask for your move and give an example of how to enter the move in.

Additional possibilities, Some additional features that could be added would be an AI that plays against the user. or even an option to undo moves or save games.

Through this project I have learned a lot about coding with C, especially the use of Makefilws and bit operations.
